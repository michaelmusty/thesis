 \Large $2$-group Belyi Maps\\

\normalsize \textit{Abstract}
\end{center}
This thesis concerns the explicit computation
of Galois Belyi maps
$\phi\colon X\to\mathbb{P}^1$
with monodromy group
a $2$-group,
which we call $2$-group Belyi maps.
The computation has two parts.
The first is a combinatorial computation
to enumerate the isomorphism classes
of $2$-group Belyi maps.
% This computation provides evidence to
% a conjecture that every $2$-group
% Belyi map is defined over an abelian
% extension of $\QQ$.
% A partial proof to the
% conjecture for certain $2$-groups is given.
The second part is an explicit algorithm
to compute equations for the algebraic curve
$X$ and the Belyi map $\phi$.
\par
The motivation behind computing these maps comes from Beckmann's theorem,
which relates the primes of bad reduction of
$X$ to the primes dividing the order of the monodromy group of $\phi$.
Beckmann's theorem also implies that the field of
moduli of a $2$-group Belyi map is unramified away from $2$.
Are these moduli fields always solvable?
Is the field generated by the $2$-power torsion
subgroup of the Jacobian of $X$ solvable over $\mathbb{Q}$?
This work aims to provide the computational framework
to begin answering these questions.
% All computations are carried out using
% \textsf{Magma}
% \cite{magma}
% and the source code
